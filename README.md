# Virusim

## What does this project do?

The idea is to create a configurable simulation of a viral infection. The software is intended to be used inside the browser mainly for educational purposes. This project is open-source and non-profit.

## Why is this project useful?

While the primary focus for this project will be educational purposes (for example using it in online courses about viruses, immunology and viral infections) there might be further applications possible.

## How do I get started?

### Live version

A live version of the software can be found at [https://www.virusim.org](https://www.virusim.org).

### Who are you looking for?

Currently we're looking for enthusiastic people who are willing to join this open-source and non-profit project. Concretely we're looking for:
- JavaScript/TypeScript developers
- Biologists/Immunologists/Virologists/MDs to guide the project and to input useful requirements and domain-specific knowledge
